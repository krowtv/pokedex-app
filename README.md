## PokeAPI
The PokeAPI is a RESTful API that handles all of the data pushed to the app.
https://pokeapi.co/

## Database
To limit API calls a local database is built with the API and updated once weekly with
new data. This optimizes app performance as all information loaded can be accessed directly
from the local pokeDB folder.
