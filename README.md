# Pokedex App

A Pokedex App built in React using the PokeAPI

Check out the build here!

## PokeAPI
The PokeAPI is a RESTful API that handles all of the data pushed to the app.

## Database
To limit API calls a local database is built with the API and updated once weekly with
new data. This optimizes app performance as all information loaded can be accessed directly
from the local pokeDB folder.

### To-Do
#### Optimize search feature 
Ensure the search bar autofills with the most likely search as a Pokemon name is typed out.

#### Add Pokemon Cards
Dedicated Pokemon cards should display detailing more Pokemon information such as stats, evolutions, moves learned, etc.

#### Improve Pokemon Table
Add more data to be shown on the table for each Pokemon.
